            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the
                central government is expected to bring profound changes to education in India. The policy approved by
                the Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India's new education system.[30] The new
                policy replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education. The policy is a comprehensive framework for
                elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India.
                The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2021.[31]

                The National Education Policy 2020 has ‘emphasised’ on the use of mother tongue or local language as the
                medium of instruction till Class 5 while, recommending its continuance till Class 8 and beyond.[32]It
                also states that no language will be imposed on the students.[33]The language policy in NEP is a broad
                guideline and advisory in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and schools to decide on the
                implementation.[34] Education in India is a Concurrent List subject.[35]</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">School education</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the
                "10+2" pattern of education. In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years
                in Junior colleges (Mumbai, Maharashtra) and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree for
                college.[43] The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High
                School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges. This pattern originated from the recommendation
                of the Education Commission of 1964–66.

                There are two types of educational institutions in India, 1) Recognized institutions – primary school,
                secondary school, special schools, intermediate schools, colleges and universities who follow courses as
                prescribed by D.P.I. , universities or boards and they are also open for inspection by these authorities
                , 2) Unrecognized Institutions, which do not follow conditions as said in the recognised ones.[45]
